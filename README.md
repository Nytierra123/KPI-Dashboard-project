# Interactive KPI Dashboard - Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive KPI Dashboard designed to help businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Sales, Operations Costs, Marketing Spend, New Customers, and Customer Churn Rate. 

It includes:
- A Python script that generates realistic business KPI data (`capstone_final.py`).
- A live dashboard built using Google Looker Studio, visualizing the data with bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and scorecards.

## How To Run This Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nytierra123/KPI-Dashboard-Project.git

2. Run the Python script to generate the CSV:
python3 capstone_final.py
This will create a file called `kpi_data.csv`.

3. Upload the `kpi_data.csv` into [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) to create or update your dashboard.
